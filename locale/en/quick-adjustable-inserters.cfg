[string-mod-setting-description]
qai-range-for-long-inserters-retract-then-extend=Adjustable range will first increase inwards until there is no gap between the inserter base and its reachable tiles, at which point the adjustable range will extend outwards.
qai-range-for-long-inserters-extend-only=Adjustable range will only extend outwards, leaving a gap between the inserter base and its reachable tiles even with all range technologies researched.\nWith vanilla and 3 range this causes long handed inserters to be able to reach over beacons and machines which is quite a big difference.
qai-range-for-long-inserters-extend-only-without-gap=Adjustable range will only extend outwards, however all tiles from the inserter base to the adjustable range will also be reachable.\nWith vanilla and 3 range this causes long handed inserters to be able to reach over beacons and machines which is quite a big difference.

[mod-setting-description]
qai-near-inserters=Should the Near inserters technology exist to allow adjusting the drop position within a tile?
qai-long-inserters-1=Should the Long inserters 1 technology exist to increase the adjustable range of inserters to a maximum of 2?
qai-long-inserters-2=Should the Long inserters 2 technology exist to increase the adjustable range of inserters to a maximum of 3?
qai-more-inserters-1=Should the More inserters 1 technology exist to allow inserters to pickup/drop to/from cardinal as well as diagonal tiles within adjustable range?
qai-more-inserters-2=Should the More inserters 2 technology exist to allow inserters to pickup/drop to/from every single tile within adjustable range, so the full grid?
qai-normalize-default-vectors=Should the mod attempt to snap the pickup and drop vectors of all adjustable inserters to "valid" vectors? Disabling this may cause some inserters to have default vectors which once modified cannot be restored again. However if this causes compatibility issues, it can be disabled.
qai-show-throughput-on-inserter=Show estimated inserter throughput when hovering any inserter.
qai-show-throughput-on-pickup=Show estimated inserter throughput when adjusting the pickup position.
qai-show-throughput-on-drop=Show estimated inserter throughput when adjusting the drop position.
qai-highlight-default-drop-offset=While adjusting the drop position highlight the drop offset within a tile which is determined to be the default.
qai-always-use-default-drop-offset=Even with Near inserters researched, continue selecting whole tiles using the default drop offset. With Mirrored inserters only this skips selecting drop entirely. -- TODO: mention key bind to enable adjustment once, or whatever the key bind is going to do
qai-pipette-after-place-and-adjust=Automatically pipette (__CONTROL__pipette__) the inserter after having used __CONTROL__qai-adjust__ to place an inserter and having adjusted said placed inserter.
qai-pipette-copies-vectors=When using pipette (__CONTROL__pipette__) on an inserter, so long as it is held in cursor newly placed inserters will have have the same pickup and drop vectors.
qai-mirrored-inserters-only=When enabled, inserters are only allowed to have pickup and drop positions/tiles exactly opposite of each other, mirrored at the center of the inserter.
qai-range-for-long-inserters=How exactly should the adjustable range affect which tiles long handed inserters are able to reach? Long handed inserters such as the vanilla ones which by default can reach 1 tile further than regular inserters, but also modded inserters with longer reach.\nWith very long range inserters, such as those in Renai Transportation, this causes a few frames to be skipped, purely because of the sheer amount of invisible entities getting created and destroyed.
qai-range-for-long-inserters-overridden=[font=default-bold]Overridden by Smart Inserters startup settings.[/font]\n__1__
qai-about-smart-inserters=Smart Inserters is enabled, which means it is the primary mod and all its settings and technologies are used. The ones from this mod are hidden and disabled.
